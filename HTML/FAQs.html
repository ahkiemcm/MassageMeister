<div class="q-a-box" onclick="answer()">∆ What is massage therapy?</div>
    <p id="q-a-reveal">
        Massage therapy is a reknowned health practice that contributes positively to one’s 
        general health and wellness, while also working the body’s soft tissue to assist relief of pain and
        stiffness associated with stress, tension, injury and other conditions. 
       
    </p>


    
<div class="q-a-box" onclick="answer2()">∆ Is massage therapy just for relaxation?</div>

        <p id="q-a-reveal2">
        Massage therapy is so much more.
        Massage helps to manage pain, reduce stress, improve circulation and mobility, decrease muscle tension, lower blood pressure, promote sleep, 
        manage anxiety & depression and helps improve your overall wellness.

        It definitely helps for relaxation, though.
</p>



<div class="q-a-box" onclick="answer3()">∆ How do I find the right massage therapist for me?</div>

        <p id="q-a-reveal3">Let our team know what kind of experience you're interested in, and alert us of any health 
            concerns you may want addressed during your session. Here at Massage Meister group, our licensed therapists are trained
            in several modalities and are experienced in using their toolbox to tackle whatever issue may occur.

            The real question is, what are YOU looking for?
</p>


<div class="q-a-box" onclick="answer4()">∆ What can I expect at my first massage?</div>

        <p id="q-a-reveal4">During your first massage, you and your therapist will discuss the areas of your greatest
            concern, any health issues or medical history that they should be aware of during the session, and any areas you may want
            the therapist to avoid. This should mostly be review. Afterwards, your therapist will step away to allow
            you privacy to disrobe to your comfort level (if at all) before laying on the massage table as instructed by your therapist.

            We love to give great first impressions! If you are a first timer, you've come to the right people!
</p>


<div class="q-a-box" onclick="answer5()">∆ How often should I get a massage?</div>

        <p id="q-a-reveal5">

        The general recommendation of frequency of massage is 1 session about every 4 weeks. However, each individual is different.
        If your therapist deems your condition to require more frequent work, they may suggest a different treatment
        plan for you. Don't worry, it is only a recommendation and it is not mandatory. 

        But you'll be glad you followed their advice if you do.

</p>


<div class="q-a-box" onclick="answer6()">∆ Can I get a massage if I am already in pain?</div>

        <p id="q-a-reveal6">
        Massage is a great tool for pain relief and management, and with appropriate pressure, massage can assist with 
        easing any pain or discomfort you may be expeienceing. However, if your pain is caused by an injury deemed too 
        dangerous to massage for fear of making matters worse, then it would not be recommended.

</p>


<div class="q-a-box" onclick="answer7()">∆ Will I experience muscle soreness after my massage?</div>

        <p id="q-a-reveal7">It’s not uncommon to feel some muscle soreness after a massage. 
        Massage triggers a release of lactic acid stored in tight muscles, 
        which can create a temporary feeling of soreness. But with habits of hydration and stretching, 
        many people enjoy heightened energy and increased range of motion post-massage. 

</p>


    <div class="q-a-box" onclick="answer8()">∆ Do I have to take off all of my clothes?</div>

        <p id="q-a-reveal8">Nope!! You can receive an effective massage regardless of what clothing (if any) 
        you choose to remove. Your comfort and ability to relax is a top priority for our therapists,
        and the only way to receive the optimum benefits of your massage. 

        LMT's are trained to make sure that the fresh linens on the massage table always drapes you and 
        ensures your privacy. If at any time you feel uncomfortable due to pain, treatment or draping, 
        please do not hesitate to let your therapist know.
