<p>It's no wonder, with all the back and forth of our day to day lives,
    that we are all so sore and tired. We lack the time to properly rest ourselves, and
    society encourages recovery by way of pharamceuticals and "partying". As the Massage Meister
    group, we advocate not only for the inclusion of massage into your choices for relaxing yourself,
    but for the general adoption of a holistic lifestyle. Here we detail a few different ways that you can
    begin to live more holistically and to take care of yourself.

<h2>Massage</h2>
<div class="read-box">
<p>
There are several benefits of massage, for your body as well as for your mind and emotional state.
Though it isn't a fix-all for diseases or the cure for broken bones, it has been found in some studies to aid 
in a number of conditions including:
    <ul>
        <li class=benefit>Anxiety</li>
        <li class=benefit>Headaches</li>
        <li class=benefit>Fibromyalgia</li>
        <li class=benefit>Stress-related Insomnia</li>
        <li class=benefit>Sports-related Injuries</li>
        <li class=benefit>Myofacial Pain Syndrome</li>
        <li class=benefit>TMJ Pain</li>
        <li class=benefit>Digestive Issues</li>
        <li class=benefit>And, of course, General Stress!!</li>

    </ul>

    Despite its benefits, massage isn't meant as a replacement for regular medical care, just as an accessory. 
    Let your doctor know you're trying massage and be sure to follow any standard 
    treatment plans you have.

<h2>Water intake</h2>
<p>We as humans are made up of 60%-70% water. This alone should speak to the importance of drinking plenty of
    water daily, and yet many of us fall short of necessary amounts due to massively busy schedules, general pre-occupation,
    or just the desire to avoid using the restroom every 20 minutes. Still, it is an important component that we cannot pass up
    if only for the sake of our bodies. There are benefits to keeping your hydration levels checked:

    <ul>
        <li>A vital nutrient to the life of every cell, acts first as a building material.</li>
        <li>It regulates our internal body temperature by sweating and respiration</li>
        <li>The carbohydrates and proteins that our bodies use as food are 
            metabolized and transported by water in the bloodstream;</li>
        <li>It assists in flushing waste mainly through urination</li>
        <li>acts as a shock absorber for brain, spinal cord, and fetus</li>
        <li>forms saliva</li>
        <li>lubricates joints</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Stretching</h2>
<p>
The muscles of the body are attached to our bones, along with our ligaments and tendons. 
They pull on their attachments to produce movement against the forces of gravity, and they possess an
elastic-like resiliance. With that said, muscles can lose their resiliance over time when they are used heavily,
not properly hydrated, and not stretched. Stretching and performing activities such as yoga can produce some
positive effects like:

<ul>
    <li>Flexibility and posture</li>
    <li>Injury prevention</li>
    <li>Increased blood and nutrient circulation</li>
    <li>Calmer mind and spirit</li>
    <li>Release tension</li>
    <li>Increased energy</li>

</ul>

<h2>Food</h2>
<p>
        Most people know good nutrition and physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight. 
        But the benefits of good nutrition go beyond weight. Good nutrition can help:
        
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce the risk of diseases like:
                <ul>
                <li>Heart disease</li>
                <li>diabetes</li>
                <li>Stroke</li>
                <li>Cancer</li>
                <li>osteoporosis</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Reduce High blood pressure</li>
            <li>Lower high cholesterol</li>
            <li>Improve well-being</li>

<h2>Meditation</h2>
<p>

        The popularity of meditation is increasing as more people discover its benefits.
